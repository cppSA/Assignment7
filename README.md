Assignment 7 in c++ course
Operator overloading c++ , pure virtual class and inheritance.
In this repository you will find 17 files regarding the seventh exercise given in CPP course. 
  - Cell.cpp - is the class we wrote with the code needed for the functionality of our class Board.
    Cell.h - is the header file with everything needed for our Cell.cpp code to work. 
  - OurException.cpp - contains two classes, we wrote with the code needed for the functionality of our class Board.
                       The IllegalCharException class - is exception for a character that can not be.
                       The IllegalCoordinateException class - is exception when there is a way out of the Board. 
    OurException.h - is the header file with everything needed for our OurException.cpp code to work.
  - Board.cpp - is the class we wrote with the code needed for the functionality of our program. 
    Board.h - is the header file with everything needed for our code to work.
  - Coordinate.cpp - is the class we wrote with the code needed for the functionality of our class Board.
    Coordinate.h - is the header file with everything needed for our Coordinate.cpp code to work.
  - Player.h - is the header file with everything needed for pure virtual class Player.
  - DummyPlayers.cpp - contains four classes, we wrote with the code needed for the functionality of our game.
    1. The XYPlayer class.
    2. The YXPlayer class.
    3. The IllegalPlayer class.
    4. The ExceptionPlayer class.
    
  DummyPlayers.h - is the header file with everything needed for our DummyPlayers.cpp code to work.
  - Champion.cpp - is the class we wrote with the code needed for the functionality of our game.
    Champion.h - is the header file with everything needed for our Champion.cpp code to work.
  - TicTacToe.cpp - is the class we wrote with the code needed for the functionality of our program.
    TicTacToe.h - is the header file with everything needed for our code to work.
  - Makefile - is makefile we wrote for compilation.

All 16 files were compiled and tested using the main from [homework](https://github.com/erelsgl/ariel-cpp-5778/tree/master/week06-inheritance/homework). 
Please note the documentation throughout the code.
